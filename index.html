I did my primary education at two different schools and then later changed schools for my secondary schooling. I graduated from high school last year and this is my first year (second semester) of university studying Bachelor of Information Technology. I originally was doing the Associated Degree in Applied Science but I wasn’t enjoying it so I ended up changing to a different degree entirely. In my spare time, I love to watch and play sports, my favourite being basketball and my favourite team is the LA Clippers. Some other sports that I enjoy playing are volleyball, boxing, MMA and gridiron football. I also enjoy cooking and have recently got back into cars. </p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>My project is to create a live streaming service that is better for the users i.e., the streamers and the viewers. Live Now Streams will be the best live streaming service in the future. Live Now Streams will be a platform for live video streaming, which will offer practically any anything you’d want to watch, whether it be cooking, music, Q&A sessions, video games, conferences/presentations, events, classes and more. Live Now Streams will be more secure and safe for users to protect them and make their experience good, it will also give streamers more freedom and enforce rules equally to all the users and won’t give preferential treatment. Live Now Streams will be the new and improved Twitch and YouTube Live.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>My project is interesting because it can ultimately give twitch a run for their money, because over the years twitch has become a more and more negatively viewed live streaming service. Due to things like DMCA strikes, hate raids and unfairly banning streamers. I plan to create a service that gives users more enjoyable streaming time. Twitch currently has 2 million active users and 27000 monthly streamers and YouTube has 2.6 billion users and in the second quarter of 2022 YouTube had a 518 concurrent viewers, so there is a huge market for a streaming services. A new service like Live Now Streams will bring a new dynamic to the market.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>Similar to Twitch and YouTube, Live Now Streams will have some of the same features such as real-time/live chat system, web services that provide access to functionality and data storage systems</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>There are a few required tools and technologies required to create Live Now Streams, for the live chart system application programming interface would be required which is a software that allows two applications to communicate with each other. Application programming interface allows for broadcasts and streaming to be more interactive. For the technology required to live stream a video camera or web camera is required, a modem for an internet connection, audio source can be a microphone or whatever you chose and a hardware and software encoder. Hardware encoders are for the processors so they can encode the data into content you can stream. Software Encoders are the programs you use on your device to connect the hardware (video and audio) to the computer to live stream.p>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>The required skill to create Live Now Streams is to have a strong understanding and experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Version Control Software, PHP, and cloud technology.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>If my project is successful, it will be the best live streaming platform on the market edging out Twitch and YouTube. Live Now Streams will be the most user-friendly service in the market, what makes Live Now Streams better and different is the way it will be managed and regulated. Live Now Streams will be more secure and safe for users to protect them and make their experience good, as mentioned before rules will be equally enforced to all the users and won’t give preferential treatment like other services on the market. Live Now Streams will change the market completely and will be the service of the future.</p>
